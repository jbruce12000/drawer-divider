# drawer-divider

Openscad file to create a drawer divider

Features:

- created using openscad
- create dividers of any height, length, and thickness
- create connectors for dividers bigger than you can print and join two or more
- tight tolerances, but easy to install
- no trimming, print to fit

Instructions:

- measure your drawer
- using openscad or thingiverse customizer, create dividers of the length and height you need
- if dividers are too long to print, print multiple dividers and print as many connectors as you need to join them. Hide the divider, show the connector. The connector will fit your customized divider.
